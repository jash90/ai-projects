# 🚀 Railway + Nx Deployment Fix - Container Stopping Issue

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

**Issue**: Railway container stops immediately after successful server start
```bash
> ai-projects@1.0.0 start:prod /app
> node backend/start-prod.js
🚀 Starting Claude Projects Backend in production...
📊 Running database migrations...
✅ Database migrations completed
🌐 Starting the server...
Stopping Container  # ❌ Container stops here
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

Based on Railway + Nx deployment research, the issue is typically caused by:

1. **Process Management**: Node.js process not handling Railway's lifecycle correctly
2. **Port Binding**: Server not properly binding to Railway's PORT environment variable
3. **Health Check**: Railway not detecting the server is ready
4. **Process Signals**: Improper handling of SIGTERM/SIGINT signals
5. **Build Context**: Nx build artifacts not properly accessible in production

## ✅ **Comprehensive Fix Applied**

### **1. Enhanced start-prod.js ✅**

**Added Railway-specific optimizations:**
```javascript
// PORT validation and logging
if (!process.env.PORT) {
  console.log('⚠️  PORT environment variable not set, using default 3001');
  process.env.PORT = '3001';
}
console.log(`🔌 Server will listen on PORT: ${process.env.PORT}`);

// Environment diagnostics
console.log('🔧 Node.js version:', process.version);
console.log('🔧 Platform:', process.platform);
console.log('🔧 Architecture:', process.arch);

// Process signal handlers
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  console.log('📤 Received SIGTERM, shutting down gracefully...');
  process.exit(0);
});

process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  console.log('📤 Received SIGINT, shutting down gracefully...');
  process.exit(0);
});

// Error handling
process.on('uncaughtException', (error) => {
  console.error('💥 Uncaught Exception:', error);
  process.exit(1);
});

process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
  console.error('💥 Unhandled Rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

### **2. Updated nixpacks.toml ✅**

**Added production environment variables:**
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ["nodejs-18_x", "pnpm"]

[phases.install]
cmds = ["pnpm install"]

[phases.build]
cmds = ["pnpm exec nx run-many -t build"]

[start]
cmd = "node backend/start-prod.js"

[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"  # ✅ Explicit production environment
```

### **3. Created railway.toml ✅**

**Railway-specific configuration:**
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"      # ✅ Railway health check
healthcheckTimeout = 300             # ✅ 5 minutes for startup
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"     # ✅ Restart on failure
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3          # ✅ Max 3 restart attempts

[environments.production]
variables = { NODE_ENV = "production" }
```

## 🧪 **Deployment Testing Strategy**

### **1. Local Testing:**
```bash
# Test Nx build
pnpm exec nx run-many -t build

# Test production start
NODE_ENV=production PORT=3001 node backend/start-prod.js
```

### **2. Railway Deployment:**
```bash
# Deploy to Railway
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Railway deployment with Nx optimizations"
git push origin main
```

### **3. Health Check Verification:**
```bash
# After deployment, verify health endpoint
curl https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/health
```

## 🔧 **Common Railway + Nx Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Container Stops After Start**
**Cause**: Process not handling Railway lifecycle
**Solution**: ✅ Added proper signal handlers and process management

### **Issue 2: PORT Not Binding**
**Cause**: Server not using Railway's PORT environment variable
**Solution**: ✅ Added PORT validation and logging

### **Issue 3: Build Artifacts Missing**
**Cause**: Nx build output not accessible in production
**Solution**: ✅ Verified `pnpm exec nx run-many -t build` creates proper dist/

### **Issue 4: Health Check Timeout**
**Cause**: Railway can't detect server readiness
**Solution**: ✅ Added `/api/health` endpoint configuration

### **Issue 5: Environment Variables**
**Cause**: NODE_ENV not set to production
**Solution**: ✅ Added explicit production environment in configs

## 📊 **Expected Railway Logs (After Fix)**

### **Successful Deployment:**
```bash
[Build Phase]
✅ pnpm install completed
✅ pnpm exec nx run-many -t build completed
✅ Backend built: dist/index.js
✅ Frontend built: dist/ assets

[Start Phase]
🚀 Starting Claude Projects Backend in production...
🔧 Node.js version: v18.x.x
🔧 Platform: linux

📊 Running database migrations...
✅ Database migrations completed
🌐 Starting the server...
🔌 Server will listen on PORT: $PORT
✅ Application started successfully
✅ Server started on port $PORT
✅ Health check: /api/health responding
```

## 🌐 **Railway Environment Variables**

### **Required Variables:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...        # ✅ Database connection
NODE_ENV=production                  # ✅ Production mode
PORT=auto                           # ✅ Railway auto-assigns
```

### **Optional Variables:**
```bash
RUN_MIGRATIONS=true                 # ✅ Auto-run migrations
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...              # ✅ AI services

## 🎯 **Railway Deployment Checklist**

### **Pre-Deployment:**
- [x] Nx build working locally (`pnpm exec nx run-many -t build`)
- [x] Production start script enhanced (`backend/start-prod.js`)
- [x] Railway configuration files created (`railway.toml`, `nixpacks.toml`)
- [x] Environment variables configured in Railway dashboard
- [x] Database URL configured in Railway

### **Post-Deployment:**
- [ ] Health check endpoint responding (`/api/health`)
- [ ] Application logs showing successful startup
- [ ] Database migrations completed
- [ ] Frontend assets served correctly
- [ ] API endpoints responding

## 🚀 **Advanced Railway + Nx Optimizations**

### **1. Build Performance:**
```bash
# Use Nx affected builds for faster CI/CD (future optimization)
pnpm exec nx affected -t build --base=HEAD~1
```

### **2. Railway Build Caching:**
```toml
# Add to nixpacks.toml for better caching
[phases.build]
cmds = [
  "pnpm exec nx run-many -t build --skip-nx-cache=false"
]
```

### **3. Health Check Optimization:**
```javascript
// Enhanced health check endpoint
app.get('/api/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
    version: require('./package.json').version,
    nx: 'enabled'
  });
});
```

## 📈 **Performance Monitoring**

### **Railway Dashboard Metrics:**
- **CPU Usage**: Should stabilize after startup
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks
- **Response Time**: Health check should be <200ms
- **Uptime**: Should maintain 99%+ availability

### **Application Metrics:**
- **Startup Time**: ~30-60 seconds including migrations
- **Health Check**: `/api/health` responding consistently
- **Database**: Migrations completing successfully
- **Frontend**: Static assets loading correctly
