- **[nx-monorepo.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/nx-monorepo.mdc)** - Nx-specific guidelines and task management

### 🎨 Frontend Development
- **[frontend-development.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/frontend-development.mdc)** - React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and state management guidelines

### ⚙️ Backend Development
- **[backend-development.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/backend-development.mdc)** - Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and API development guidelines

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **[testing-quality.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/testing-quality.mdc)** - Testing strategies, Jest, Playwright, and code quality standards

### 🤖 AI Integration
- **[ai-integration.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/ai-integration.mdc)** - AI/ML integration, OpenAI, Anthropic, and streaming guidelines

### 🗄️ Database & API
- **[database-api.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/database-api.mdc)** - PostgreSQL, API design, authentication, and data validation

### 🚀 Deployment & DevOps
- **[deployment-devops.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/deployment-devops.mdc)** - Docker, nginx, CI/CD, monitoring, and production deployment

### 🔧 Nx Integration
- **[nx-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/nx-rules.mdc)** - Nx Console integration and workspace management

## Quick Reference

### Technology Stack

- **Deployment**: Docker, nginx, CI/CD

### Key Commands
```bash
# Development
pnpm dev                    # Start all development servers
pnpm build                  # Build all projects
pnpm test                   # Run all tests
pnpm lint                   # Run linting
pnpm type-check            # Run type checking

# Database
pnpm run db:migrate        # Run database migrations
pnpm run db:seed           # Seed database

# Nx Commands
pnpm exec nx run-many -t build    # Build all projects
pnpm exec nx run <project>:<target>  # Run specific project target
```

## Rule Application

### Automatic Application
- Rules with `alwaysApply: true` are automatically applied to every request
- Rules with specific `globs` patterns apply to matching files
- Rules with `description` can be manually referenced when needed

### Best Practices
1. **Follow the established patterns** defined in each rule file
2. **Use the referenced file paths** to understand the codebase structure
3. **Apply consistent coding standards** across all projects
4. **Leverage the monorepo benefits** for code sharing and consistency
5. **Maintain proper separation of concerns** between frontend and backend

## Contributing

When adding new features or making changes:
1. Follow the guidelines in the relevant rule files
2. Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
3. Update rules if new patterns or technologies are introduced
4. Ensure all tests pass and code quality standards are met

## Support

These rules are designed to help maintain a high-quality, consistent codebase. If you need clarification on any guidelines or want to suggest improvements, please refer to the specific rule files or the project documentation.
